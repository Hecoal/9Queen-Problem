Solution to the 9 Queens problem in chess

This git repository contains a program that solves the 9-queens problem in chess using backtrack. The 9-queens problem is a generalization of the classic 8-queens problem, where the goal is to place nine queens on a 9x9 chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The program uses a recursive algorithm that tries to place a queen in each row, and backtracks if the placement is invalid or leads to a dead end.
